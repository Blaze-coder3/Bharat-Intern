# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This project aims to build a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their features. The project is part of the Bharat Intern Virtual Internship program, focusing on hands-on experience in machine learning and neural networks.

## Project Structure

- **[code.ipynb](code.ipynb):** Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for the project.
- **[README.md](README.md):** Project documentation providing an overview, instructions, and details about the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git
    cd iris-classification
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook code.ipynb
    ```

## Project Details

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The Iris dataset is loaded and preprocessed to prepare it for model training.
- **Neural Network Architecture:** A complex neural network is defined using Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The model is tuned using RandomSearch for optimal hyperparameter values.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** The best model is selected and evaluated on the test set. Accuracy and performance metrics are calculated.
- **Visualizations:** Various visualizations, including training history, confusion matrix, and distribution charts, provide insights into the data and model performance.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of [Your Accuracy]% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying iris flowers.
